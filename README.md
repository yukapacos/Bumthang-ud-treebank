Bumthang Dependency Treebank (BDT)
- A Universal Dependencies corpus for Bumthang, a Tibeto-Burman language

BDT was built for a honours project at the Australian National University.

DESIGN
It contains: 
- 1,044 Bumthang sentences 
- 5,033 words
- 21 dependency relations
- 13 POS tags

All the sentences were was mostly collected from linguistic elicitation conducted during a linguistic field methods class in 2015, and subsequent elicitation sessions in 2016-2017 at the Australian National University. The dataset also includes data collected by Dr. Mark Donohue during his fieldwork in Bhutan in 2012.

The sentences were manually annotated into Universal Dependencies, following the CoNLL-U format.

CONTRIBUTOR
Bumthang Dependency Treebank was created by:
- Yuka Morinaga (yuka.morinaga28@gmail.com)

KNOWN ISSUES
- The size of BDT is extremely small. Over 1,000 Bumthang sentences are yet to be annotated to be incorporated into BDT.
- Bumthang dependency morpho-syntax and BDT annotation scheme needs revisions on: auxiliary verb, indirect object, coordination
